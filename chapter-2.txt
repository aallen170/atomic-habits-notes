- Change your identity, not the outcome

- "Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.

You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes, rather than creates, then you'll continue to be pulled toward spending, rather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you'll be drawn to relaxing, rather than training.

It's hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that lead to your past behavior."

- Pride plays a major role in maintaining habits.

- "The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity.

It's one thing to say, 'I'm the type of person who wants this.', and it's something very different to say 'I'm the type of person who IS this.'

The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.

If you're proud of how your hair looks, you'll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it.

If you're proud of the size of your biceps, you'll make sure to not skip another upper-body workout.

If you're proud of the scarves you knit, you'll be more likely spending hours knitting each week.

Once your pride gets involved, you'll fight tooth-and-nail to maintain your habits."
